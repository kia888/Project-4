What is this?
A sorted linked list 

What does this program do?
This program reads a list of Integer numbers from the scanned input and saves them into a Linked List, sorted from the smallest to the largest.

Benefits:
Ordering - the list will maintain a specific order, Insertion and Deletion - can be done efficiently compared to unsorted linked lists, Operations - searching for a specific value

Example:
